## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `init-openskills` skill: `/initOpenSkills` command for automatic brownfield adoption
  - Auto-detects tech stack from manifest files (csproj, package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.)
  - Identifies architecture pattern from directory structure (Clean Arch, MVC, microservices, monorepo, etc.)
  - Detects code conventions from existing source files (naming, error handling, validation, testing)
  - Generates AGENTS.md, RULE_REGISTRY.md, rules, wiki pages, and IDE pointers in one pass
  - Interactive confirmation before writing any files
- **Proactive Qdrant session context (STEP 3c)**: Agent silently queries Qdrant before starting non-trivial tasks
  - Checks past sessions for relevant decisions, lessons, and context
  - 5 scenarios: task start, entity encounter, architecture decision, debugging, file history
  - Mirrors Graphify's proactive impact analysis pattern

### Fixed
- Subagent-driven-development: added independent review option (4th choice after task completion)
- Graphify plugin: corrected installation to `uv tool install graphifyy` (PyPI, not npm)
- Graphify plugin: added "No API Key Required for Queries" clarification
- **Proactive impact analysis (STEP 3b)**: Agent now queries graphify before code changes to detect affected dependents

- 7 universal rules + stack-specific rule templates (empty + best-practice variants)
- Second-brain wiki template with Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern (raw_sources → artifacts → wiki)
- Memory plugins: Qdrant session memory (Tier-1), Graphify code graph (Tier-2)
- Setup scripts: setup.sh (Bash), setup.ps1 (PowerShell) with interactive and non-interactive modes
