<execution_workflow>
Run this dispatch loop BEFORE every response. Do NOT skip it for "simple" tasks.
<SUBAGENT-STOP>EXCEPTION: When dispatched as a focused task subagent, skip this skill.</SUBAGENT-STOP>

## STEP 1 — Authority hierarchy (resolve conflicts)

Order: user explicit instructions → `.sumela/sumela-prompt.md` → loaded skill bodies → `.sumela/rules/*.md` → IDE default. User instructions ALWAYS override; the user is in control. If a skill body and the prompt file disagree on session bootstrap or signal capture, the prompt file wins. If a rule contradicts a loaded skill workflow, the skill wins for that workflow phase.

## STEP 2 — Signal capture from previous turn (silent)

Apply `.sumela/sumela-prompt.md` `<signal_capture>` exactly. High/medium-confidence `correction`, `confirmation`, `decision`, `friction`, `challenge`, `resolution`, or `preference` signals load `self-improvement-curator` and create pending queue entries. (`resolution` = a bug/problem the agent fixed on its own — capture the generalized lesson, not the instance; `preference` = a proactive standing user instruction.) Mutations still flow only through `/evolve`.

## STEP 3 — Information gap check (silent, BUT enforced via canonical contract)

Before answering, ask: "Do I need context I don't already have?" Apply the canonical `<information_gap_routing>` block BEFORE drafting.

For deep workflows (ingest, code-commit, lint) or when multi-collection Qdrant routing is needed (`wiki_pages`, `code_chunks`), load `using-second-brain` and follow its INFORMATION GAP RESOLUTION section.

NEVER skip Tier-2 routing for matching call-graph/structural questions (FAMILY B); Tier-1 (FAMILY A session history) is best-effort — skip when `chat_history` is known-empty.

### STEP 3b — Proactive Impact Analysis (silent, before code changes)

**WHEN:** Before modifying any function, class, method, or file — if the graphify-code-graph plugin is active (`.sumela/memory-plugins/graphify-code-graph/scripts/query-graph.py` exists).

**HOW:**
1. Identify the symbol(s) being changed (function name, class name, method name).
2. Run: `python .sumela/memory-plugins/graphify-code-graph/scripts/query-graph.py "<symbol>" --impact`
3. Parse the output: which files/classes/functions depend on this symbol?
4. If impact is non-trivial (3+ dependents): silently expand the change scope to include all affected files. Verify each affected file still compiles/works after the change.
5. If graphify is unavailable or graph.json is missing: skip silently — no fallback needed, this is an enhancement.

**WHY:** A change to `AuthService.RegisterAsync` might break `AuthController.Register`, `LoginFlow.Execute`, and `UserIntegrationTest`. Proactive impact detection prevents cascading failures without requiring the user to ask "what else is affected?"

**RULE:** This is SILENT — do not announce "I'm checking impact via graphify" unless the user explicitly asks. Just do it and incorporate the results into your analysis.

### STEP 3c — Proactive Session Context (silent, before starting tasks)

**WHEN:** Before starting any non-trivial task (implementation, debugging, architecture decision) — if the qdrant-session-memory plugin is active (`.sumela/memory-plugins/qdrant-session-memory/scripts/query-qdrant.py` exists).

**HOW:**
1. Extract the core topic of the current task (entity name, feature name, bug description, decision topic).
2. Run: `python .sumela/memory-plugins/qdrant-session-memory/scripts/query-qdrant.py "<topic>" --limit 3`
3. If top score ≥ 0.5: read the matching session summary. Look for:
   - Past decisions that affect the current task
   - Lessons learned from similar work
   - Known issues or gotchas encountered before
   - Files or entities that were discussed
4. Incorporate relevant context silently — reference prior decisions, avoid repeating past mistakes, build on established patterns.
5. If Qdrant is unavailable or score < 0.5: skip silently — no fallback needed, this is an enhancement.

**EXAMPLES:**
- Task: "Implement comment deletion" → Query: "comment deletion" → Found: Sprint 15 discussion about soft-delete pattern → Agent uses soft-delete instead of hard-delete
- Task: "Fix blank images in feed" → Query: "feed images blank" → Found: Session summary about media URL normalization → Agent checks the same root cause first
- Task: "Add rate limiting to polls" → Query: "rate limiting polls" → Found: Decision about sliding window policy → Agent follows established pattern

**RULE:** This is SILENT — do not announce "I'm checking past sessions via Qdrant" unless the user explicitly asks. Just query, read relevant context, and incorporate into your task execution.

## STEP 4 — Skill discovery and loading

Walk through the active task and load every skill whose `description` matches:

- Process skills (load BEFORE implementation skills): `brainstorming`, `idea-explore`, `writing-plans`, `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`.
- Implementation skills: `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`.
- Quality gates: `verification-before-completion`, `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review`, `finishing-a-development-branch`.
- Cross-cutting: `secure-coding-standard`, `performance-optimization`, `shipping-and-launch`.

INTENT ANCHORS — match these explicitly; they are easy to miss because they sound like casual conversation, but they ARE task entry points:
- "What should I build?" / "suggest a feature or improvement" / "what would add value?" / "let's discuss an idea" — INCLUDING when the user has NO concrete idea yet and just wants options — load `idea-explore` (divergent ideation), which hands off to `brainstorming`. Do NOT answer a feature / idea / "what do you suggest" / "let's discuss" request conversationally without entering this loop — a discussion tone is not an exemption.
- A concrete, already-chosen feature ("add feature X", "build a Y") → `brainstorming` directly (design → spec). This INCLUDES requests where the user describes the task in great detail (acceptance criteria, field lists, endpoints, even file names): detail makes the brainstorming loop FASTER (fewer clarifying questions, possibly a 3-sentence design), it does NOT make the skill skippable. The only inputs that bypass `brainstorming` are an already-approved spec (→ `writing-plans`) or an already-approved plan (→ execution skills).

GLOBAL SECURITY MANDATE — If the task involves planning, writing, or reviewing code, load `secure-coding-standard` regardless of whether the user mentioned security. This fires at PLAN time, not first-code time: `brainstorming` and `writing-plans` count as "planning code".

PHASE-RULE SYNC (MANDATORY, on every skill load) — When a skill you are loading activates a phase per `.sumela/RULE_REGISTRY.md` `<phase_definitions>` (e.g. `writing-plans` → `planning`, `executing-plans`/`subagent-driven-development` → `implementation`), re-run `sumela-prompt.md` STEP 4 for the NEW phase: consult `<phase_to_rule_matrix>` and READ every missing universal, phase-conditional, stack-conditional, and domain-conditional rule BEFORE executing the skill's workflow. Bootstrap-time rule loading does NOT cover phases entered later in the session.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>If a skill might apply with even 1% probability, load it. Memory of a previously-read skill is NOT a substitute for re-reading the current file.</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## STEP 5 — Skill execution protocol

- Announce loaded skills inline only if the user asked what you're doing; otherwise stay silent.
- If a loaded skill contains a checklist, create a TodoWrite item per step.
- Cross-check skill dependencies — e.g., before any commit step, ensure `requesting-code-review` is queued.
- INTERACTIVE PAUSES — When a skill explicitly asks the user (TDD opt-in, architecture choice, double-approval), STOP and wait. Never assume "yes".
- Skill types: rigid skills (e.g., `systematic-debugging`, `secure-coding-standard`) follow exactly — do NOT adapt away discipline; flexible skills (architecture patterns, conventions) adapt principles to context. The skill body declares which.
- Once loaded, the skill's `<execution_workflow>` is the operating directive for that phase.

## STEP 5b — Context Manifest (visibility checkpoint)

Print the Context Manifest only when `.sumela/sumela-prompt.md` `<context_manifest_protocol>` requires it: on explicit user request, or immediately before a high-stakes action (commit, code-review dispatch, finishing a branch, shipping, `/evolve`). Do NOT print it at session start or on phase transitions — answer directly. When a trigger fires, the GAPS section is the lint layer; don't skip it.

## STEP 6 — Forbidden rationalizations

- "This task is too simple to need a skill" — wrong, run the dispatch loop anyway.
- "The user already described exactly what to build, so the design is done — I can start coding" — wrong, a detailed request is `brainstorming` INPUT, not an approved spec; the sumela-prompt DEVELOPMENT GATE forbids code without an active implementation skill working from an approved plan.
- "Let me ask the user a clarifying question first" — wrong, skill check runs BEFORE clarifying questions.
- "I'll explore the codebase / check git first, skills later" — wrong, skills tell you HOW to explore; files lack conversation context.
- "I'll just do this one small thing first" — wrong, check BEFORE doing anything.
- "I remember this skill, no need to re-read" — wrong, skills evolve; load the file.
- "I'll commit and review later" — wrong, `requesting-code-review` runs before any commit.
- "Inline execution is equivalent to subagent dispatch" — wrong unless the skill defines an explicit IDE Fallback Protocol.
- "The manifest is noise, I'll skip it" — wrong at its triggers (user request, pre-high-stakes action); there it is the only way the user sees GAPS. (Outside those triggers you correctly do NOT print it.)
